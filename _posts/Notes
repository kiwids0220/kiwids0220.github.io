# Notes 

## Spin Locks

	- Spin lock are used to lock shared data to make sure there’s only one thread executed by one processor to access it.

	- Dispatcher objects are provided by the kernel to the Executives

	-Dispatche Obj vs Spin lock:
	- Spin lock will keep trying to require the lock, dispatcher object will put the thread to suspended state

Mutex vs Event
	-  Event doesn’t provide the mutual exclusiveness between threads executed by processors while Mutex and Spin locks do
