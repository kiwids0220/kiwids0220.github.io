## PCIe Study Notes

### ACPI x64-based PC 

PCIe bus is not the initial layout of the system presented by firmware during boot. ACPI (Advanced Configuration & Power Interface) is what describes the existence of PCIe to the OS. 

### PCIe Tree Root Complex

The PCI Express Root Complex

#### PCI Express Root Port
Similar to a port on motherboard 
A port that another PCIe Endpoint or PCIe Switch can be connected to.
- An Endpoint ( a physical device - Type 0)
	- configured as a device to talk to
- A Switch (a Bridge device - Type 1)
	- other is configured as a device to route packets
- **Root Complex Integrated Endpoints**Â (RCIE, Marked in Green below) since they are intergrated directly on the **Root Complex**

#### Bus/Device/Function
##### Bus
#bdf
- All busses on the system are identified with a number (0-255)
- Bus/Device/Function identifies where in the PCIe hierarchy the device is located so we can communicate with it.
- Bus "0" lcoated on the **silicon of the CPU***

Ex. Bus 0

##### Device 
- Device ID represents a physical device 

##### Function
- Function ID represents the distinct capablity the physical device supports and expose to the system
- A device that exposes more than one function is a **Multi-Function Device (MFD)*** - More PCI connections (e.x., NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 4070TI and NVIDIA HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO devices)
